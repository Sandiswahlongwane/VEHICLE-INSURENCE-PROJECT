# CUSTOMER SEGMENT ANALYSIS ON VEHICLE INSURANCE DATA TO ENHANCE CUSTOMER RETENTION
 
## Project Context
How can we increase insurance coverage among low-income populations in Africa, where only 3% of the population has access to insurance products? The average insurance penetration in Africa was 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023,  which is much lower compared to the global average of approximately 7% of gross domestic product (GDP).espite the poor economic climate, technological advancements, and the presence of microfinance institutions, the insurance industry in Africa has the potential to grow. The key question is what strategies can be implemented to increase insurance uptake in Africa.
 
## Problem Statement
This project aims to identify the different customer profiles in vehicle insurance data to maximize customer retention. The benefit of this analysis will be to provide insights to the targeted vehicle insurance company that will assist them in devising appropriate marketing strategies to improve customer loyalty and acquire more clients.
 
## Why Insure?
Vehicle insurance is essential due to risks beyond accidents. Many people cannot afford the cost of replacing a stolen or totaled vehicle out of pocket. Comprehensive insurance coverage helps mitigate this risk by providing compensation if your vehicle is stolen. Additionally, intentional damage to vehicles (such as vandalism) is a reality, and comprehensive coverage ensures protection against such incidents. Repair costs can be high, especially for modern vehicles with advanced technology. Insurance coverage helps cover repair expenses, making it more affordable for vehicle owners. Beyond theft and accidents, other common perils include fire damage, which comprehensive insurance typically covers. Having the right insurance provides financial security and protects your investment.
 
## Reasons for the low rate of insurance industries in Africa.
There are a lot of factors contributing to the low penetration of insurance in Africa including the following:
 
- Lack of funds, mistrust amongst insurers, superiority complex by multinational insurers which do not want firms to invest in Africa, lack of reliable information, poor legal and judicial systems, and lack of qualified and experienced personnel, are some of the reasons for low insurance penetration in Africa (Ben Kajwang, 2020).
- Financial literacy levels, Poor quality of service, and stringent regulatory requirements were the main contributing factors to the low level of insurance uptake of insurance products in Zambia (Haamukwanza, L. C., 2021).
- Lack of insuring culture by Africans is a contributing factor to low insurance penetration in Africa (Ajayi, E., 2015).
 
## Goal of the project
We will work with the insurance claims dataset to find the patterns of potential customers who will be interested in vehicle insurance. This project groups similar claims based on characteristics like demographics, behavior, and claims history to identify trends.
 
## Project Findings and Conclusion
Understanding customer profiles through data analysis can help insurance companies tailor their products and marketing strategies and increase customer retention. From the PowerBI dashboard, we can identify the potential customers and group them into either high or low-risk. Low-risk customers have low claims, meaning they are less likely to be involved in car accidents, resulting in lower insurance premiums. The opposite is true for high-risk customers who have high claims and higher insurance premiums.
 
1. Average Claims per Customer Occupation:
Handlers and cleaners generally have the highest vehicle claims and are classified as high risk, whereas administrative clerical workers have the lowest claims and are considered low risk. This disparity may be attributed to the fact that administrators often work remotely, while handlers and cleaners typically have higher car usage due to frequent commuting.
 
2. Average Claims by Education Level:
Customers with a PhD have the fewest claims, while those with an associate degree have the highest claims.
 
3. Average Claims by Vehicle Make:
Ford, Dodge, and BMW have the highest vehicle claims, while Jeep, Volkswagen, and Toyota have the lowest claims.
 
4. Average Claims by Accident Type:
Single-vehicle collisions result in the highest claims compared to parked car incidents. This is often due to risky behaviors such as speeding or distracted driving, which lead to more accidents and consequently higher claims.
 
5. Total Claims by Age:
Middle-aged customers have the highest claims compared to younger and older customers. This may be due to cognitive changes affecting driving behavior. Younger customers tend to have less expensive cars, which may result in cheaper repairs.
 
6. Fraud Risk:
In situations where fraud was reported, the total claims were lower compared to situations with no reported fraud. Additionally, customers who commit fraud tend to have lower premiums.
 
 
Identifying potential customers based on their claims history and developing targeted campaigns for them aids in retention, enhances customer satisfaction, and potentially reduces future claim costs by addressing specific risk factors and needs proactively.
